for my first wireframe, colour palattes and typography were not mainly focused on. the header placement and design layout were experimented with.

### theme
the overall theme of the website is social media apps such as instagram, especially the sidebar containing the home, messages, notifications and explore buttons. however, instead of the search bar being on the side, there will be a global search bar at the top of the website, similar to the one on airbnb.
